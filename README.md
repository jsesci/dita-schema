# Schema for DITA 1.3 - Unofficial Mirror of All-Inclusive Grammars for DITA 1.3, Sourced via DITA TC at OASIS


## Project Information

Project: `dita-schema`

Source Code Repository: [`https://github.com/jsesci/dita-schema`](https://github.com/jsesci/dita-schema)


## Synopsis

The DITA 1.3 specification is maintained by the
[DITA Technical Committee (TC)][dita-tc] at [OASIS][oasis]. The
specification is published, principally, in three parts -- each,
available separately, with an additional _All-Inclusive_ distribution
as including all three parts of the specification.

The parts of the DITA 1.3 specification are available as follows:

* Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) Version 1.3 Part 0:
  **Overview** [(HTML)][dita-1.3-p0-html][(PDF)][dita-1.3-p0-pdf]
* Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) Version 1.3 Part 1:
  **Base Edition**  [(HTML)][dita-1.3-p1-html][(PDF)][dita-1.3-p1-pdf]
* Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) Version 1.3 Part 2:
  **Technical Content Edition** [(HTML)][dita-1.3-p2-html][(PDF)][dita-1.3-p2-pdf]

The _All-Inclusive_ edition is available as follows

* Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) Version 1.3 Part 3:
  **All-Inclusive Edition** [(HTML)][dita-1.3-allinc-html][(PDF)][dita-1.3-allinc-pdf]

This repository is constructed from the contents of the distribution of
the DITA 1.3 specification, as
[published -- in a combined format][dita-1.3-zip] -- within a "Zip"
archive file available via the OASIS DITA TC. The same archive file --
available at approimately 47 megabytes, in compressed form -- includes
formal schema or _grammars_ for DITA 1.3, in the syntax of XML DTDs,
XML Schema, and RELAX NG schema. In addition, the archive file
includes HTML and PDF editions of the primary three sections of
the specification, as well as a Compressed Help Metafile (CHM)
distribution of the specification. The DITA XML source code of the
specification -- in DITA 1.3 XML syntax -- is also provided, in the
same archive file.

This repository is provided in the interest of facilitating the
distribution of the DITA 1.3 schema for applications in XML editing
workflows, such as may be applied in a manner principally independent
of any single commercial vendor platform for DITA applications.
